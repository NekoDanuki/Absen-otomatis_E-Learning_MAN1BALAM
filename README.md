**This project is subject to change since my experience in C and socket programming is less than two weeks.**

I made this project cuz I'm too lazy to open my browser.

I gladly accept pull requests.

**If you're using Windows or Mac or smth, rewrite the code yourself.  I don't give shit about OSs other than Linux.**

# What's New
I rewrote this project in C. Also, I no longer use curl.

# Dependencies
Some POSIX and GNU or smth header files.

# Configuring Account
Make a file named `akun`. If exist, don't waste your time making it.
